# Just In Time Interventions

Last semester this subteam replicated the analysis of [Gardner and Brooks, 2018](https://learning-analytics.info/journals/index.php/JLA/article/view/5814). Weekly success was predicted for individual students who took ISYE6501 during the Fall of 2018 using a variety of different data and models including grade information and clickstream data.

# Fall 2019 Deliverables
* Revise models to improve results
    * Longer training time
    * Add more data from past semesters
    * More engineered features
    * Perhaps different modeling techniques (HMM?/Others, see [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2611750))
* Build automated pipeline for ETL and training
* Analyze feature importance
* Research just in time interventions
* Develop app that automatically alerts professors to students in danger of dropping

# Team Roles and Responsibilities
* **Project Manager** Coordinate tasks between team members, keep project tasks up to date, lead presentations
* **Data Scientist** Write scripts to process data, train models, and evaluate results
* **Web Developer** Build interventions into edX
