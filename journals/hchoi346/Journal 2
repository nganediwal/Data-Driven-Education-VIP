Github
	Not using our time to do something that isn't what we need to do
	Worked on setting up docker and running script to prepare to do stuff for the future
	Also talked about what we want to do and more along the lines of what we are interested in
		subteams within our subteams
	
	Had a major problem with my docker and spent the whole time trying to reinstall/uninstall Oracle VMBox but it wouldn't disappear
	Talked about our research question and whether or not we would want two models
		one for dropout and one for grades

	Also talked and considered spreading our goals for long term (from this semester to next semester also)
