looking to seperate the dataframe into 3 more dataframes (A, B, C) in order that we can display the averages for A, B, C for the student to view in his student window.

Looking to add this to the MergeWrapper class (Which already has the data frame) so that we can also calculate all the average for the student as well.

Worked on this a bit, was mainly a working day today for the meeting.
