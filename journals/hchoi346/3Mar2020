Steps for MongoDB:
    Docker -> 'sbin/ddestart.sh' in the folder that holds the sbin folder
    -> 'awsconfigure' -> put in credentials (server is us-east-1)
    -> './ec2_start.sh' -> you're in!

Worked on grouping the data into A, B, C, D, F labels in order to stop using dummy data.

Found out the variable we were trying to use 'df'  wasn't actually the variable of the data frame and that's why we kept getting empty DF's.
Realized a lot of the dataframes in MErge Wrapper are actually irrelevant; they are empty. Worked on fixing these df's.

Stopped/stuck on index, row for the for loop
