What I did this week:
	started displaying the images on the page
	Seems like we'll have to do each one at a time
	There are specific ones that don't look good in a 3x1 so I will put those on a single 1x1 first.

What we talked about:
	Final steps, final dates
	Caught up on what everyone's doing
	had a mini work day
