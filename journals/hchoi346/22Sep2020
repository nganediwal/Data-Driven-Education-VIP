What I did this week:
	Created the Resources page that looks like this the home page but with different links.
	The links lead to tutoring, the directory for GT, as well as advising for students.
	Can be replaced/changed to be links to anything else.
	Also added a button that links to the home page for ease-of-access that looks better than the old.

What we talked about this week:
	Presentation, what we are going to do for this week
	Planning on working on connecting to the elephant sql.
