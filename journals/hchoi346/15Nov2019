Met and fixed up queries to match
    realized that the two query table id's that we were going to use actually had different sets of id's. 
    Had to find out and search for a way to combine these two sets of data with differing id's.
    Put in some work and made sure the wrapper classes were working for SQL > pandas
    Left early because we couldn't access the data without user_id_map

    Shawn told us that our user_id should match up with anon_id in student_anon_id
    so we queried into that and made a table with both student_id and anon_id and made a giant table for two wrappers!
    also completed forum query and combined both sets of queries (so 3 queries total) into one giant table in pandas ready to be used
        as food for the machine learning algorithms

    started looking at ML python files and syntax;
    looking to do a linear regression with the data that we will save as a CSV file onto the docker container as a hidden file (So that when docker is killed, the file will also disappear unless we deliberately move it to a different folder)
