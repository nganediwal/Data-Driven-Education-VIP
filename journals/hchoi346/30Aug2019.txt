	ML using data to predict the data
	SAT is x vs Grade is y
	Using clickstream data to find out success in the classroom from their grade and assignment life (time left to do, etc)
	
	Overfitting:
		too much data, your algorithm finds irrelevant data or trend because you have too much data (or coincidences)
	Using the least number of feature sets to find the best applicable trend

	Adaboost - small trees and averages together to find the edge cases

	Sequel database is a large spreadsheet
		columns of grades but we don't have that from the very beginning

		from a No sequel mongoDB server
			full of documents that are all different

	MongoDB:
		no sQL data, full of documents

	Relational dB
		datasheet

	nonrelational db
		random blobs of data

	cleaning the data:
		into a spreadsheet form that we can use for ML

	ROCAUC
		metric for figuring out how well your model did
		Receiver operating characteristic: Area under curve

	5% disease rate, 95% accuracy rate if yyou do nothing
		doesn't mean that not doing anything is a good model

	Options:
		revision
			longer training time
			data from past semesters
			more features
			different modeling technique (HMM)
		Look at all the code and make sure it's working
			pipeline doing data transformation with one click to training
		Best intervention method
		app to alert professors to students in danger of dropping/failing

	flask lti python

	binary prediction
		dropout and when
		vs grade and passing/survival rate
