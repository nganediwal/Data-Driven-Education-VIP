9/13 subteam meeting
	Downloaded and set up PGAdmin and started doing with Postgres
	Learned about writing queries and finding data
	learned about renaming spreadsheets and assigning them to variables in order to create a table on the conditions that we give
		E.G. if the user id on both spread sheets are the same, we would collect data from both spreadsheets since the data should be for the same person
	left/right join
		indicates side to keep all information from (Even if its not the same from the other spreadsheet)

	Started working on our presentation
	
	To do:
		make presentation slide on data arrangements
		mess around with data from PGAdmin and make sure it works/we understand it
