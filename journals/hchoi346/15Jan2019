How are we going to intervene with the data that you have?

Create web app this semester for use by Joel (6501) professor for feasibility

Pop-up idea (?)
    get a notification of "people like you are more likely to succeed in this course!"

Email idea
    email as a back up to the pop-ups for students (maybe those who are in danger and maybe everyone)
    saying 'hey you should watch a video' or 'interact more in the forum'
    Actual solutions versus just 'intervention'
    TA's and professors' abilities to add onto the emails and add tips or hints
