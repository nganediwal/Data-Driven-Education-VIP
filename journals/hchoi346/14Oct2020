What I did this week:
	made a fake dummy model with random #'s
	made scroll wheel for table
	made grade predicter show with fake dummy model
	It's super inaccurate and wonky. Had to deal with string types within a numpy array of floats. Have to work on easing out the model

What we talked about:
	ML side did a presentation on what they did
	talked about pngs and using the graphs and plots that they've made onto our UI
	aiming to make milestones for web-app.

	View for png's and new button
	Use Aashay's function in studentdata.py
