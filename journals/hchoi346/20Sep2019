Splitting into two subteams and start doing things seperately
	Could be that clickstream data could be used for both and that assignment data isnt as useful for some people

MongoDB
	blob style data base
	individual blobs and these blobs may or may not have certain fields
	need to panda to get table or applicable data to link with the SQL team and create the final data framework

Produce features that are relevant
Get data and then run scripts to set up data for use
	Create table and a way to organize the data and use

Final goal:
	Table with Student and current week and everything up to that week

Now -> next-next friday 10/11
	Write queries to extract features
	Use data documentation
	look at papers
	explore data
	look at old queries
		-> next-next-next friday 10/25
			Begin to engineer features that are based on features obtained

Final goal:
	1. run python script within a container and control the queries we would need (while running queries)
	2. Perform data/feature engineering with stuff obtained
 	3. Output Panda's dataframe

Panda dataframe -python data manipulation tool

0 - first week of class

To Do:
	try new Mongo script and make sure the environment is set up using new environment provided by Sean
	explore the data and features and possibly write a query or two
