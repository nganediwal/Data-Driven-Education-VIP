Manley wants the team to spend time with the SQL for how to appropriately find submission data.

I am still quite inexperienced with SQL so this is a real struggle for me at the moment. I will continue to look at the EdX data in hopes of grasping a feel for the what I am supposed to be looking for.

## TO-DO:

1. Prepare to present some initial findings.
2. Learn more SQL.
