Suggested to Shawn that we query data based on individual assignment grades as a means of matching IDs across Canvas and Coursera.
But I am not sure how viable this method is. He said he would get back to me on the best way to do this.

## To-Do:

-See if there is merit to this idea.

-Ask Manley for assistance in querying assignment data in Canvas per individual assessment.
