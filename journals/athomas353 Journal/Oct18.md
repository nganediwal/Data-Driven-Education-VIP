# Meeting Notes
## TO-DO
* Today it was decided that Anusha and I will officially begin our work creating queries in PgAdmin that will make it easier for us 
to aggregate through our old data and identify common factors we want to cary over into our new longer-scale project
* Manny, Matthew, and Hosuk make up the official MongoDB team
* I have a lot of personal review to do of Pg Admin before I can really get to work, so that is todays overall goal
