# Meeting Notes 
## Todays TO-DO
* There is still much work to do in getting comfortable with PgAdmin but in our meeting today we discussed all of the goals we
have for what we expect our model to do once all the data is gathered in cleaned
* Anusha and I are still finding ways to work through the old data and we've even continued to review Gardner and Brookes paper
in order to identify any attributes we might want to incorporate in our new queries
