# February 20, 2021: Subteam Meeting #3
## Team Meeting
* Today I led the UX design research interview with Sonam Singh and recieved the following feedback:
** 1.1 Overview
  - Overall, good, standard overview page. 
  - Consider removing past three weeks performance underlay on performance graph 
  - Should remove task actions and improve score from overview, as this page should be more informational than interactive
  since each function has its own page
  
** 1.2 Performance 
  - Likes that course specific details are displayed 
  - Expand on course specific performance information, and reconsider having performance chart appear on both overview and 
  performance page
  - Consider using icons rather than/alongside color to alert a student about a particularly low grade 
  - Don't want to discourage students rather than encourage them to improve their grade once they've been alerted 
  
** 1.3 Improve
  - Be more clear about what 'Take Action' means and what clicking the button will do 
  - Layout is nice, and the minimalist design is clear easy to work with
  - Important button is too hard to see, consider changing for the sake of potentially visibly impaired users 
  - Add in a way for students to rearrange their goals 
  - Consider a split page design with tasks on one side and user made goals on the other 
  - Get rid of extra terms such as 'New' on the improve your score items 
  - Add more detail to advisor meeting section to clarify how the student can interact with that section 
  - Want as few interactions on a page as possible 
  
** 1.4 Profile
  - Check out the GT student records and include information such as their graduation date to help the student feel more 
  connected to the institution 
  - Consider adding a feature for students to change their profile picture
** 1.5 Settings 
  - Privacy is a good thing to have
  - Consider adding a place 
  - Add a way for students to enable push notifications 
  - Could add extra tab for profile specific settings 

## Work Completed
