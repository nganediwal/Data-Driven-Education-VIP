# February 13, 2021: Subteam Meeting #2
## Team Meeting
* We split into teams to work on LTI integration, assessing and updating our wireframes, and 
running new data through our models

* New Data Updates: 
  * Recieved new data (CS1301 and MGT100 Clickstream Data), needs cleaning and restructuring to be in structured tables
    * Look into negative weeks and missing/empty userid entries 
  * Want to improve models to better predict students grades based on their 
clickstream data (edX) collected on a weekly basis from the course. 
  * Additionally, students will recieve personalized feedback on what they can focus on 
  to improve their grade (i.e. viewing the homework earlier than later in the week it is assigned)

* Wireframe Improvements:
  * Our current plan is to continue implementing the features included in our wireframe to the current application 
  * Link to wireframe: https://www.figma.com/file/S5BFYHAMWM9SCvywrrB5o1/JITI-Web-App?node-id=0%3A1
