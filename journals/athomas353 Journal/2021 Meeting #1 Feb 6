#February 6, 2021: Subteam Meeting #1 
##Team Meeting
* Today Saurabh gave us a rundown of where we left off last semester 
  * Switched from using Slack to Microsoft Teams, and implemented the official use of the Trello board to keep up with
  overall team progress
  * Experimented with using different MOOC course data to evaluate the impact of clickstream data on students performance
  * More heavily implemented the research example conducted by Gardner and Brooks
  * Additionally analyzed unsupervised learning, and the results showed that students that did well had a steadyily
  increasing amount of active weeks in the course as the course went on. Those that did not perform as well had significantly
  lower involvement rates 
* Two teams within the subteam 
  * Front-End/UI Team: Now using newly improved Css
