# Just In Time Intervention: Meeting Three
## September 13, 2019 
### Meeting Notes 

* Today we took some to time to get pgAdmin 4 downloaded onto out devices 
  - We then ran through some of the sequel files we will be working with this semester 
  - We also discussed what variables and such we will be using in the data this semester 
  - Read the abstract and problem within the reading by Garner 
  
* Preparing for Wednesdays presentation 
  - How do we want to word the research question? 
  - 15 minute presentation 
  - Reasearch question, Master plan, Phase 1: Data, Phase 2: Models, Evaluation, Things we've done so far, etc. 
  - Decididng if the model is succesful, what intervention tool will we be using? (Email, alerts, etc.) 
  
* Current Research question 
  - If we release a tool to professors to track their students progress in the class, will we be able to predict a students drop out week or end grade in the course?
  - We also want to fogure out WHY the student is predicted to do so poorly 
  - Considering predicting at certain intervals in the class (Week 1 - Week 4) (Week 4 - Week 8) 
  - Would we be able to do this using only old data as the driving data and using the current data as the testing data 
  
* Possible data arrangement styles 
  - Using all current data mixed together (Past and new data alike)
  - Other idea is using all past data to train; the most recent semester will be a test 
  
* Presentation Assignments 
  - Ania: High-Level Motivation
  - Manley: Introduction 
  - Matt Yang: Modeling 
  - The rest is TBD
