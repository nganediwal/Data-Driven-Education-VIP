# VIP: Date-Driven Education [First Meeting]
## August 30th, 2019 

### Meeting Notes
  * Today we discussed the past plan for the project; what was and wasnâ€™t executed from the original presentation.
  * Our (Past) Master Plan focused on:
    + Aggregate/ Clean Data
    + Create a library of models 
    + Evaluate model success
  * ROC: AUC 
    + Reciever Operating Characteristic: Area Under Curve 
  * Possible Plans Discussed:
    + Revisit/ revise previous models 
    + Add more data (We will be doing this) 
    + Consider the code we have and make sure it's all still fully functioning 
  * Begin working on/cleaning up on JavaScript, Django, Python, and Flask. 
    + Ideally, two members of our team will branch off to work on a tool that automatically assigns the median of 3 peer-reviewed grades in Canvas.  
  * Consider looking at both potential success and potential drop out 
  * Read: Gardner and Books 2018 and the Journal Analytics 
  * Research SQL and MongoDB 
    + Join, query, select, aggregate, and filter 
    + Tools: PostgreSQL
