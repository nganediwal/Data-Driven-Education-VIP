# Meeting Notes 
## Todays TO-DO
* Today I communicated with Anusha and we are officially on the same page with the new queries 
* Our current mission is to figure out how to craft a query that can obtain a students grade at the end of a given week, 
and further more, it should be able to inform us of what their grade change from the previous week was
* We are also looking more into finding out exactly how many assignments of varying types are assigned in a week and how much
each of those seperate assignment weigh so we can properly deduce what the affect these grades are having on a students score
