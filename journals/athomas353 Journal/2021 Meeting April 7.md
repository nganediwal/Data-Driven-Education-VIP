# April 7, 2021: Subteam Meeting
## General Meeting Notes
* This week we decided to break up the overall task of making immediate changes to the 
 application to look more like the wireframe by making changes on a page by page basis 
* I chose to begin with restructuring the Home page and creating a seperate Overview page to
summerize the uses of our application in its current state
* In addition to this, I focused on condensing and renaming our current pages to match the main pages we intend to have in the end:
  - Home 
  - Overview 
  - Performance 
  - Improve 
  - Settings 
  
## Proposed Immediate Changes 
### Home Page
- Keep welcome text and remove current links to other pages. 
- Prompt the user to enter their user id to recieve personalized assistance from the JITI application 
- This course ID can then be saved and used to generate the information for the following pages
  * The button on the home page should lead directly to the overview page if a valid id is entered

### [Create] Overview Page 
- Display the following information on the Overview page: 
  * Students current (predicted) grade in the course [perhaps users can decide if grade is numeric or letter]
  * Students course completion prediction 
  * Students average HW grade
  * Graph of grade progress in the course (This can be the grade progress graph from the Progress Over Time page)
  * Students plan to improve (for now this can just be a suggestion to review the available resources [i.e contacting their advisor])

### Progress Over Time Page -> Performance Page
- Rename the Progress Over Time page to be Performance as the information displayed on this page is 
related to the information we intend to display in our ideal Performance page from our wireframe 
- Include the Progress Over Time page description that used to be on the Home page at the top of the Performance page 
- Move Strengths and Weaknesses table to this page 
- All available student assignment/grade data should be displayed on this page (Such as the data table that currently appears
at the bottom of the Strengths and Weaknesses page 

### Resources Page -> Improve Page
- Rename the Resources page to be Improve as resources are provided as a form of intervention and thus a means for improving

## Next Steps 
- Look into what tasks can be generated for the Improve page based on the students performance and clickstream data
