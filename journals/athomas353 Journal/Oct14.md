### Meeting Notes: PgAdmin Team
 *In this meeting, we offically ironed out what work we need to be getting done
    - Search through old queries for viable attributes we want to reuse
    - Create new queries for new charts we need to create 
    - Adjust prior queries to account for more semesters
    - Study the data and review Gardner's paper
