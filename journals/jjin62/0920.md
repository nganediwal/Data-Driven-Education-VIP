### Meeting
* Split up into PostgresSQL and MangoDB teams to work on clickstream and assigment data seperately
  * MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time
  * Use pandas to create final data tables
* Extract relevent features

### ToDo
* Study data dictionaries
* Explore data
* Begin to engineer features
