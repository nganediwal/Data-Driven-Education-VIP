Met with research sub-team for first time. Originally tried meeting in Klaus 1207 but did not have authorization and subsequently decided to meet in Klaus 1440 where all VIP students have access. There is also no one meeting in the room at the time we want to meet.

Decided sub-team will meet each Monday from 1:15 - 2:45 PM.

Spoke about project trajectories and what variables we wanted to account for. These included:
-Clickstream
-Assignment Scores
-Forum Posts

Generally got to know the strengths of one another.

Wanted to have read Gardner and Brooks paper by next meeting.
