Present for this meeting were the following:
-Manley Roberts
-Yili Hui
-Arjun Patel
-Okubay Gebrelibanos
-Maxwell Bach

We wanted to work on an idea for the process of working with the data and research variables. We decided to break into “sub-sub-teams” wherein one group would work with clickstream data and one would work with assignment data.

These sub-sub-teams will be Clickstream with Arjun, Maxwell and Assignment with Manley, Okubay, Yili.

Looked back at previous work I had done with VIP regarding predictive student success using Bayesian data trying to determine how successful a student in a course would be conditioned on how much they interacted with course material. This was a presentation given at the GT STEM Education Expo in December 2016.

Began discussing Docker for working with data as a way to not risk storing personally identifiable information on local machines or worse posting any on GitHub.

Started the preamble for group presentation for Wednesday’s 2/6/2019 general VIP meeting.

Encouraged everyone to get RIB certification by next meeting.
