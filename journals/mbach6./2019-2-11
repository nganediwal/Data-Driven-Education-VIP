Present for this meeting were the following:
-Manley Roberts
-Yili Hui
-Okubay Gebrelibanos
-Maxwell Bach
-NEW TEAM MEMBER: Divye Gala

Discussed the merits of working with OMS vs unverified student data. Decided ultimately only to use verified student data for project for the following reasons:
-These students have the motivation to complete the coursework throughly because they actually pay for it.
-Auditors do not receive letter grades for the course as they are on a Pass/Fail basis.
-Verified students has Canvas and EdX data to work with.

Got a sense of what new team member Divye was capable of. As an architect of the Canvas data, he has doubts about how useful clickstream data will be. We have decided he will work with the Clickstream team to see how valuable that will be.
