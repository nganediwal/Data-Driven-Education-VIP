# Week 5 Ending 09/26

## Team Meeting(30th Sep):
  - Learned about Analytics Research Highlights for two seperate reseach project
  - MSA Applicant Success Prediction Project
    - Can we predict whether an applicant will be admitted?
    - Which application features predict successful admission?
    - Methods
      - Logistic Regression
      - Random Forest
      - Gradient Boosting
      - ADABoostClassification
    - The applicants’ GPA played the most important role for being admitted to the program.foloowed by the duration that the applicant spent in a college.
    - The projetc made progress in data processing and succeeded model training & performance testing with reasonably high accuracy
    - Future Work
      - Model the successful completion of the OMSA program
      - Predict students’ grades in three core courses
      - Build models predicting various success metrics
  - Analyzing MOOC Environment Using Clickstream Data
    - Conventional metrics such as final grade is not accurately capture the experiences of learners hence the need to use alternative measures, such as usage patterns in exploring course content
    - How do learners from various demographic backgrounds (e.g., gender, language)interact with a MOOC environment?
    - How is learners’ interaction with the MOOC coursewarerelated to their course engagement?
    - Data Findings:
      - 20% female & 79% male students, 29% came from USA, 37% holding Bachelor’s degree & 27% Master’s or professional degrees
      - On average, enrolled students completed 13% of total content & stayed active for 6.6 weeks
      - Only 5% of total enrolled students were “explorer"
    - Some interesting findings 
      - Female students seem to be more responsive to course navigation features
      - Patterns of navigating course content may be associated with different learning outcomes depending on language background
  - Discussed the potential use of similar research items in the JITI Data modelling team.

## TODO Tasks:
  - Explore feature importance further
  - Analyze the data further to some up with trends in the data. Represent them in plots.
  - Complete Mid Term Peer Evaluation
  - Build a project structure for data modeling
  - Update Trello Board based on discussion
  
## Sub-team meeting(22nd Sep):'
  - Discussed on the plan of using the new data model in the UI if time permits. 
  - Explained the data science team about the new project structure of the data model development
  - Discussed on the findings of Null removal and what Rachel found in the data and the plans to remove it.
  - Discussed on the findinds to Outlier removals from Humin 
  - Showed the team plots for the correlations of variables
  - As a next step team decided to come up with plots from their individual work that can be presented in the next Sub-Team presentation

## Work Completed
  - Add more code to do data analysis and prodeced interesting graphs
  - Completed Mid Term Peer Evaluation
  - Updated Trello Board based on the sub team meeting discussion and tasks
