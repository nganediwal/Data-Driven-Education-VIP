What I have done this week:
*Created a basic SQL file to easily insert dummy data to SQL DBs
*Created a PostgreSQL Database with ElephantSQL.
*Created a Cloud Mongo Database.
*Uploaded fake student data to both databases.
*Created a python file that connects to both databases.  Within this file, there are two functions to get a full row/document of data of a student given their student_id

What I still need to do:
*Create a local dummy model and have a function query data to put through the model in Python

What to do before next meeting:
*Work on PPT presentation (what have we done/what will we do for the backend)
*Create local dummy model (need to talk to model team to figure out a basic framework)
*Create a function within the Python file I worked on that puts student data through the local dummy model
*Make sure to communicate with Attush more!!
*Talk to Matthew about if I should push my python files to git or not
