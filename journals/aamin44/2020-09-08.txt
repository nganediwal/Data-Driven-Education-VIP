What to do before next meeting:
*Work on creating dummy local DBs (Mongo and Postgres)
*Learn how to connect with these dummy DBs with Python
*Query data via Python
*Create two function (one for each DB) i.e. getStudentData(student_id)
*Create another function to have student data go through a local dummy model
