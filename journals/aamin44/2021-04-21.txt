This week:
* Completed integrating all spring 2021 models to the frontend.  This includes organizing the entire file structure within spring_2021_real_models folder of JITI Flask App, converting the runtime created by Saurabh into a class, updating the frontend place holder to input a week, etc.  Reflections:
	* Better handling can be done for the issues regarding invalid student id, invalid weeks.  This is a next semester thing
	* Maybe look into doing a better job of dealing with having to set the filepath within the class created - everything is currently hardcoded.  Creating a self.path variable may help with moving around the entire directory later on.
* Added what has been completed to the presentation slides, semester overview, plans for the future.

Next week:
* Recording should be done sometime this week with the rest of the team
* If I manage to find time, I will work on putting the insights graphs into the frontend, although this may not happen due to how busy I am :(


Meeting notes:
* Go over presentation progress so far, discuss final things in order to wrap up the semester.
