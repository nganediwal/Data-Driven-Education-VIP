What I have done this week:
*Updated config.py to have user/password for C21U db.  Shared this config file with rest of webapp team.
*Updated functions in studentdata.py to be more flexible for getting data from multiple sources
*Added more detailed documentation for every function to prevent mistakes in studentdata.py
*Completed back-end portion of VIP Presentation

What to do before next week:
*student_data needs to be aggregated properly instead of getting the 0 index of the returned array
*take in a parameter of array of column names to apply weights to (for dummy_model_postgres function ins studentdata.py)
*try to get a reasonable number out of the fake model - right now getting a number that is too large to be considered a grade

Reflections:
*For taking in a parameter of array of column names, talk to model team.  Maybe it is better to have dummymodel CSV with two things: first row is list of column names, second row is list of weights.  This way, we don't run the risk of a weight trying to be applied to a column that doesn't hold numbers.
*I still don't understand models and had to ask Matt a bit for help.  I should spend time on youtube to look into eactly how models work, how they are set up, etc. in enterprise environments to get a better feel.
