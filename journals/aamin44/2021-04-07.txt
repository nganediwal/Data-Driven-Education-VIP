This week:
* Completed encapsulating model.  Changes are shown in JITI_Flask_App/real_model.  Deleted code from student_data.py and transferred to else where.  Made a pull request for these changes.  Reflections:
	* Problem with joblib module, need to make sure to use sklearn.extensions joblib
	* Issues with working directory for each file, in future semesters might want to consider looking into how to deal with working directories for the multiple files.
* Created PR from my branch to master - got it accepted by Saurabh

Next week:
* Incorporate charts, incorporate time-series model
* For incorporating new model, copy paste of current model stuff

Meeting notes:
* Wire Frames
	* Need less pages
	* Segment each page and add to trello
