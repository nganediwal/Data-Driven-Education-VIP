Trello:
Complete: App Dev Team: Integrate model training team's plots, Real model prediction, Accomplish as much of redesign as possible

Meeting Notes:
*Rehearsed presentation
*Rehearsed screen sharing

Reflections:
*Currently studentdata.py looks ugly with the large amount of imports and 2 functions not being even used by the frontend (they are helper functions for the model).  I might want to look into creating separate python file the model (also putting it in a class) to best encapsulate it.
*Also, based on how I restructured the app, the globalvars.py might need to be changed somehow.  I am unsure if this file fits best practices.  Might want to spend time over the break to think about / research how this can be better implemented.
