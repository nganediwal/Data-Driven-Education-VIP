This week:
* Created free canvas account in order to get an access token to be able to make API calls
* Began writing some curl commands in order to test the waters with Canvas API (an example can be found in the documentaion: https://github.gatech.edu/C21U/vip-research/blob/master/JITI_Flask_App/Website%20Documentation/CanvasLTI_Documentation.docx)
* Progressed on writing documentation of working with the basic API.
* Talked with Saurabh and the webdev team to discuss how progress is coming along.  I have stated that I will make progress with writing scripts to grant OAuth access
