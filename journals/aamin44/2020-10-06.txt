What I have done this week:
*Create a csv with random numbers for weight
*Work on a function that can take the data from psql, dot product with weights from csv
*Refactor code so variables make sense
*Added comments to make what I am doing clear
*Pushed code to branch, start pr

What to do before next meeting:
*There are a lot of things that are kind of hardcoded within studentdata.py.  Somehow abstract that out?
*Look into replacing dating.py with studentdata.py
*Ask Jonna about PSQL is set up (is there a single database with multiple tables? Mulitple databases?).  This way, I know when exactly I need to abstract out things.
