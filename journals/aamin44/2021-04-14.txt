This week:
* Completed creating frontend placeholder for this semester's models, including a drop down and everything.  This inlcuded creating completionpring.py in pages, adding a path, and adding code to app.py in order to handle the set input.  This took a long time.
* Communicated with ML team to figure out exactly what they are expecting for the backend to be able to handle and how this would be displayed in the front end

Next week:
* Begin adding stuff to the presentations
* Add to documentation - I am good, all the canvas LTI integration documentaitons is already complete
* If time permits, putting insights into the front end.


Meeting notes:
* 24th - maybe do recording for presentation
* Ania showed us wireframes, possible changes/rearrangement to do for app
	* It looks good!  It all makes sense.
