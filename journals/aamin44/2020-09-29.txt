What I have done this week:
*Change elephantSQL data to be more like the excel sheet
*The push to branch
*Begin pull request
*Change studentdata.py so that pulled data put into df

Questions I have:
*In fall2020_model, what columns are in the csv used by the model?
Answer: Don't worry about fall2020 model for now as the data used by model is pretty different than the one shared by Jonna

What to do before next meeting:
*Create a csv with random numbers for weight
*Work on a function that can take the data from psql, dot product with weights from csv
*Refactor code so variables make sense
*Try to query data and store in temp file so not making multiple calls
