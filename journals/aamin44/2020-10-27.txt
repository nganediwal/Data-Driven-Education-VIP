What I have done this week:
*There wasn't much needed from me this week, so I spent time looking into how models are used in an enterprise environment (i.e. how data is pulled, pushed through model, result pulled, etc.)
*Added to the dummy model CSV the column names to use to get data from the db.  This made the dummy model more robust against weights being applied to random columns.

What to do before next week:
*Assist Hosuk in renaming functions that were already in app.py (I renamed some, added some parameters).
*Possibly look into aggregating data by student id (look @ reflections)

Meeting Notes:
*Atush continued to work on mock-ups
*Hosuk worked on getting the images on the website, having trouble with directories
*Model team are individually looking at algorithms

Reflections:
*Watching extra videos really helped with understanding how to approach setting up our model when the time comes.  I should continue to watch videos more if I have technical questions.
*While the dummy model is getting decent, one last thing to consider is how the student data is aggregated.  From the C21U db, every student has multiple columns.  This is a weak point in the dummy model, as the weights are applied to a single column.
