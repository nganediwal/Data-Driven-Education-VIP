Things to Know for Data Access
Databases divided into → Schema (under which you have data tables)
Data is stripped of PII (personally identifiable info) 
Clickstream data → event data
Relational data  (converge and translate)→ machine learning 
X - gathered data
Y - predictions
Fitting → putting a line to data (average)
Machine learning → fitting a line to make a prediction

Ideas
Create a student dashboard (similar to MyAnalytics)

Tasks
Create a wireframe of how the dashboard should look 
Visualization****
Gain access to backend data
Authentication
Look around Github -> final presentation
 - Visualization, Front End (web design, HTML, Javascript), Backend (databases, flask)
