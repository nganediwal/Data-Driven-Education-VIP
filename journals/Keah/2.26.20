Today we spoke about the educational study that explored the learning differences between male and females enrolled
in the online course having either male or female instructors. The goal was to see how these variables affected the persistance and/or
achievement of students. The main finding was this: "we found lower persistence among women in certain age groups if the welcome video 
was presented by a female instructor or by lower-status peers. Men remained unaffected"
So women did worse or were less persistent in the class when having the female instructors rather than the males, and there was no large
difference observed of the male students
