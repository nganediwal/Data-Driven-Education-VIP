General meeting:

- missed the meeting because I had an important interview
- Created a subteam slide for plots, insight, and drafts to enable members to update in the slide as having new thoughts.

To do:

- Review the general meeting's recording and revise this journal.
- working on remove outliers for each individual numerical variables
- Try to create new variables based on intuition and drive insight from it.
