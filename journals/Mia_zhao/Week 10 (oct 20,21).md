### TODO Tasks:
   - Complete the slide for Outlier Removal and Futher analysis plot generated by Tableau
   - Check the outlier code in pipeline to make sure it run in the project flow
   - Learn the Decision Tree and Random forest Algos to prepare for the model training

   
### Sub-team_ meeting (10.20)
   - Discussed on the slides on sub team presentation
   - Compared the teams work with Gardner and Brooks paper to include in sub-team presentation
   - Discussed plans on model training
   - Decided that each team members will take up 2 algorithms each.
### Team Meeting (10.21)
   - presentation day
   
### Completed
   - Completed the slide for Outlier Removal and Futher analysis plot generated by Tableau and orgnized in the plot folder
   - Checked the outlier code in pipeline to make sure it runs in the project flow
   - Learned the Decision Tree and Random forest Algos to prepare for the model training
     #### Found insights from outlier analysis:
               - Most of students have high school or Bachelor degree
               - Student who not specified education level may associate with a lower percent of progress
               - High school graduation degree are in their age of 15-35
               - Age 20-30 may not likely to disclose their level of education and even more likely not disclose gender
               - Gender distribution for percent of progress
               - Male has a highest percentage
               - Age outliers associate with low percent progress
               - Most of student are in age 20-45
               - Age > 35 are more likely to make progress. 60 and 75 have the highest percent of progress
               - Plot some behavior related insights
