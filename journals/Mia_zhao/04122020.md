Meeting with Olivia!

- Catch up 
- Create a function with will return dummy data plot based on dropdown option.
- Enable the callback function by calling the function.
- Crate more dummy variable inside the function
- Fixed Some issues:
    - The call back function didn't feed to the dropdown.
    - The y axis format issue ( Have a common y axis which not works for all variables)
    - The X title issue( the title didn't show up before )
- Now the web is able to return graphs for  Numerical grade, homework grade, daily visits, view counts, click counts based 
  on dropdrown option.
