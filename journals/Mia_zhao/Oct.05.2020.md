Update: 

- Cleaned the NA value by simply remove them in the first stage.
- Ploted numerical variable ( ex: year_of_birth) to see the data distribution
- Created z-score columns of all numerical variables and remove the outliers with z-score bigger than 3 or lower than -3.
- Need further improvements with each individual variable.
- Created dummy variables for gender
