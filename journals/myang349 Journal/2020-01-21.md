## First subteam meeting!

To Do / Thoughts for next week:
- Wireframe for Web Application
- Read some literature on Educational research (e.g. study patterns, spreading work out or doing last minute work, most important features of clickstream data, dat analytics, etc.)
- Look through Github when we have access

Refresher of last semester:
- Clickstream data (from MongoDB)
- Script aggregates clickstream data from MongoDB to PSQL
- We have machine learning models that predicts final grade results by week
