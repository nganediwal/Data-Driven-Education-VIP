## First subteam meeting!

To Do / Thoughts for next week:
- IRB Certification (Already completed)
- Read some literature on Educational research (e.g. study patterns, spreading work out or doing last minute work, most important features of clickstream data, data analytics, etc.)
- Look through Github to review prior progress

Refresher of last semester:
- Clickstream data (from MongoDB)
- Script aggregates clickstream data from MongoDB to PSQL
- We have machine learning models that predicts final grade results by week
