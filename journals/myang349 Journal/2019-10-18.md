## 10/18/19 VIP SUBTEAM MEETING

Overview of Data format
 - ISYE6501 is a giant JSON array
 - JSON has a bunch of blobs, each blob is one event
 - Each event has "event_type" and "context: {user_id, name, etc.}"

Mongo Notes
 - MongoDB queries are efficienct, have indexing
 - PyMongo is a wrapper on Mongo JS syntax

Update 
 - Working on PSQL now : Use the available data and "pivot" it. Sum up the count of each event_type. 
 
   Column 1 : event_type, Column 2: Count
