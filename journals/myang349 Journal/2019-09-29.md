## Status
- Great presentation everyone!
- Model training team data wrangling breakdown
  - Mia will work on outliers, create some plots on what is an outlier
  - Rachel will do some plots on null data, see what's interesting
    - Compare results to make decision on how to handle missing/null/outlier values
- Web application team completed:
  - Created local databases and write functions to query
  - Display student data, display student predicted grade (hard-coded)
- Pair-coded to show web app team desired API for model prediction (reading in model from an excel file)
- Interfaced between two teams to explain how we will handle differing datasets.

## Next Steps
- App Backend: Create local dummy model, csv, read file in
- App frontend: Add flexible displaying of data, take in student id
- Model training: Work on data wrangling tasks
- Peer-eval reminders!
- Journal reminders!
