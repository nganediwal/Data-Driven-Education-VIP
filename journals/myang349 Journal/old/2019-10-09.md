# October 9th - Presentation #2!!

## Re: Just-in-time

Gave our presentation!

## Re: NLP Team

Goals: Foundation, Scalability, Impact

Phase 3: Scaling the Project (easy to use, scalable application to perform sentiment analysis on posts)

Potential challenges : Technical aspects (server for web app and LTI integration), Data Quality, and Completion on time

Note: Could potentially collaborate since we are both examining forum data

## Re: Assessment Team

Goal: Help instructors make better assessments (right now, specifically online)

Proposed Solution: Topic Analysis and Quality Analysis on the question bank

Data: Topic Analysis - Text Lemmatize + Tokenize - TF-IDF model

  - Online LDA
  
Data: Question Analysis

  - NLP-driven: Sentiment Analysis, Coherence Analysis
  
  - Statistic-Driven: Entropy Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
  
 
## To Do: Continue writing MongoDB queries and explore different way of accessign DB (writing queries in command line?)
