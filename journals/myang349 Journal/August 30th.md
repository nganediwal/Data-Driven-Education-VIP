## Subteam Meeting 1 Fall 2019

Meeting notes:

- Went over machine learning basics (using various x variables to predict y)

- Phase 1: data (clickstream data and assignment data)
- Phase 2: models want to reduce the feature set to find the most important features that give us useful results

- Last semester review: Master plan (1. Aggregate/clean data, 2. Create a library of models, 3. Evaluate model success)

- Fall 2019 Deliverables: (revise models to improve results, build automated pipeline for ETL and training, analyze feature importance,
  research just in time interventions, develop app that automatically alerts professors to students in danger of dropping)

- Languages to learn: flask, python, front end: javascript, "transitioning" to Django

- Questions: What success factors should we focus on? Drop out rate, grade, pass/fail, etc.

- Todo: Read Garder and Brooks paper, Look into basics of data analysis, researching MongoDB + SQL (Select, aggregate, query, filter, join)
