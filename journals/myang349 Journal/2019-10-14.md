## 10/14/2019 VIP SUBTEAM Meeting

- Completed a few basic PyMongo queries

- e.g. Script that gets all unique event_types (230+)

- Big picture goal is to get data and put it in the format of a table as follows:
    - Columns: Student_ID, Semester, RELATIVE Week, Event 1, Event 2, Event 3, .... Event n
    - Data will be separate by student ID, an will have the COUNT of each event_type for each week, for each semester
    
- Next Steps

  1. Write query that gets the COUNT of one specific event_type (e.g. video plays)
  
  2. Write query that gets COUNT of one specific event_type, for EACH student ID
  
  3. Write query that gets COUNT of all event_types, for each STUDENT, for each RELATIVE_WEEK
