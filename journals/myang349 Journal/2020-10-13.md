## General Work Completed
- Gave assignments for the journal club meeting
- Status update on model training team data exploration status
    - Mia did outlier analysis
    - Rachel did data cleanup on null-values
- Discussed mockup-design for front end
- Discussed path forward for rest of semester, need sync-up between model training team work + app team work.

## Additional Contributions
- Went through pair-programming example with Aashay to show an example of how to create and apply the dummy model prediction. Gave pseudocode for the API.
- Provided feedback on handling outliers / null values (may not be wise to just replace with the median), conversation with Saurabh + model training team. Need to first see how much the missing variables influence the model, analyze correlation.
- Created sub-team presentation slides and discussed distribution of slides / presentation flow
- Delegated list of front-end tasks to be completed 

## Next Steps
- Prepare mockup page for web-app design (separate from Figma)
- Prepare sync up between app and model training team
