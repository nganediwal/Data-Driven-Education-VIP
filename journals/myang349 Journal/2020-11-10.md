    - Aashay working on prediction integration
- Sync: Model training team delivered captions to app team, came up with specific feedback on how to incorporate the captions so that the page is stylized correctly.

## Additional Contributions
- Worked 1 on 1 with Aashay and provided pseudocode on how to load/query the model created by the model training team
