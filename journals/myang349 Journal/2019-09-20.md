## 9/20/19

Weekly Friday Sub-Team Meeting!!

Desired output:

Table, itemized by student and week (up to and including)

Between now and 10/11, in your team, write queries and aggregations to extract features

Until 10/25, begin to engineer features that are based on features obtained

Big picture goal: Can run a Python script inside of a container that can:
  - control and run the queries you need
  - Perform data/feature engineering on the "stuff" obtained
  - Output pandas dataframe
  
Look at old queries, explore data, use data documentation, look at papers
