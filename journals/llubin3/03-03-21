# Wednesday Meeting (03/03/2021)
- GT's Online Master's in Analytics (OMSA)
    - Can we predict whether an applicant will be admitted?
    - Which application features predict successful admission?
    - Machine Learning Methods:
        - Logistic Regression
        - Random Forest
        - Gradient Boosting
        - ADA Boost Classification
    - Takeaways:
        - Reduced the dimensional complexity of the raw application data from 9,000+ applicants
        - Identified key input variables among list of variables (154) for predictive modeling
        - Provided a promising basis for applying various machine learning algorithms
        
- Analyzing MOOC Environment Using Clickstream Data
    - How do learners from various demographic backgrounds interact with a MOOC environment?
    - How is learnersâ€™ interaction with the MOOC coursewarerelated to their course engagement?
    - Methods:
        - Analyze clickstream event data (Course navigation, Problem interaction, Video interaction)
    - Takeaways:
        - Female students were found to be less likely to enroll in STEM MOOCs and yet equally likely to complete them
        - English language learners watched the videos at a slower play rate and tended to engage less with video content
        - Further research is needed to test whether our findings will hold in other contexts

# Sub-Team Meeting (03/03/2021)
- Team will start working in breakrooms to further their own agenda
- Machine Learning Team
    - new project structure of the data model development
        - Saurabh has transformed the data to fix the repeadted coloumns
        - Cindy to work on cleaning the data (nulls and outliers)
        - I will work on data aggregations

# To Do:
- New Data Transformation Assignment:
   - Since data is not in Time Series format creat function to take culmulative number of clicks each week
   - If this does not work we could try to convert the weeks to Time Series format (More tedious)
- Read Research Paper by Dr. Soleimani
- Journals
- VIP Mid-term notebooks are due (03/10)

# Completed Work:
- Web-based Peer Evaluations
