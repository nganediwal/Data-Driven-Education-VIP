# Sub-Team Meeting (04/07/2021):
  - The team was updated on everyone's progress
  - Outlier function was finished
  - I need to update the accumulation function
  		- Saurabh will work on training the aggregated model
  		- I will work on the time-series data for MGT100
  		- Cindy will work on the time-series data for CS1301

# To Do:
  - Journals
  - the accumulation function takes very long on the CS1301 data as it is much larger
  		- Remove the loop and utilize the cumsum() function to optimize the function

# Completed Work:
  - Worked on the training the MGT100, performance was slow.
  - Journals
