# Wednesday Meeting (02/10/2021)
- Project Management for Data Science
    - Data Science solves problems with big data using predictions and new measurements
    - Data Science projects need a defined roadmap with clear timelines
- Three types of timelines:
    - Waterfall flows through sequentially cascaded phases (Think Gnatt charts)
        - These are fast and easy to understand but can be rigid with high cost of errors
    - Agile shows work broken in small increments (Kanban Boards, Trello Boards)
        - These are adaptable and great for multi-discplinary teams but it is difficult to track progress and are slow
    - MS Team Data Science Process is a comprehnsive approach
        - It will take longer to learn and is microsoft specific
- In sub-teams we discussed our project goal and what magement style we would use
