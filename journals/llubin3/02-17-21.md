# Wednesday Meeting (02/17/2021)
- Research Design
    - Scientific Reasearch is a continual process of rigorous reasoning thatbuilds understanding in the form of models
    - Formulating a Research Question:
        - Begin at the end
        - Not to broad and not to specific
        - Is it resonable given the contstraints?
        - Operationalize the research question
        - Develop a tableor graph that would answer the question
    - Types of Research:
        - Exploratory gains a new insight on to a new phenomenon
        - Descriptive describes a situation or population
        - Relational seeks evidence for correlation between two or more variables
        - Explantory derives inferences on the effectiveness of something
        - Qualitative seeks to gain an understanding of underlying user needs, motivations, and the “WHY” 
        - Quantitative quantifies the problem by way of generating numerical data or data that can be transformed
        - Mixed Method combines quantitative and qualitative research to deepen understanding
- User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
    - UX is the experience a user has while interacting with the product or service
        - UX Design is the process by which a designer tries to determine what that experience will be
        - UX Research is the process of adopting various research methods to identify the needs and interests of users 
        - Attitudinal is when you listen to what users say
        - Behavioral is when you see what users do
    - UI is the specific design assets/elements users interact with
- The Design Process -> Listen, Analyze, Design, Test

# Sub-Team Meeting (02/20/2021)
- Sub-Team Meeting Presentation prepartion
    - Assigned slides (Since I am new I was assigned one slide to discuss the upcoming plans for the model
    - Place picture in introduction slide
    - Discuss how to use old model (for CS course) on a non-STEM course (Management)

# To Do:
- Transform Data
    - Saruabh was able to create function to deal with the multiple coloumns 
    - Cindy will take on the actual cleaning
    - Realized I needed more info on what platform to use for transforming the data.
    - Met with Saruabh on Tuesday for more details.

# Completed Work:
- Downloaded Anaconda
    - Had Issues pulling from GIT
