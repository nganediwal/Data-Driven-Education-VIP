# To Do:
  - Begin working 2nd Presentatation
  - Optimize and finalize the accumulation the function:
      - Apply the function to all the columns!
      - Is there a way to do the accumulation without loop?
      - Is it possible accumulate while ignoring Null values?
  
# Completed Work:
  - Data Transformation Assignment
      - I was able to create a function to accumulate the clicks per user over each week
      - It uses a for loop (which is not effiecent) and currently only does so for one column
      - The current function requires there be no NaNs in the columns
  - Read Research Paper by Dr. Soleimani
  - Journals
