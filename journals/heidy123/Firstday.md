In the first day of our meating, we discussed the things that we wanted to do. As a result of that discusion we came out with 
the list of plans for the semester. we also went through the resources that we have online like the evaluation journal. Doing that 
helped us to have a direction. 
we also have shared our experiences about the work.
I can say it was a general introductory and begining of our meeting. 
At that point some of us did not have even get our credentials so we have not done anything about data quering.
we concluded our meeting by suggesting each person to read the paper come out with ideas that can help us write the presentation 
our first presentation.
