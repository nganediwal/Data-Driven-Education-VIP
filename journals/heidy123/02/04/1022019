the third day we all come with the credentials. first we have discussed on how we have to select our analysis in general 
and how to select representative samples in particular. Thanks getting us someone who can offer help, we have discussed with him.
Afterwards we have started to work on connecting to the software and we have done a good job on that. Finally we have divided 
the list of works into individual assignmnets so that if everyone works on his own individual assignment, things can be easily
accomplished.
