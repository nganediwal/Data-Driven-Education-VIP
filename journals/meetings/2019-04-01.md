## 04/01/2019 - Subteam Meeting

Today in the meeting, we discussed the concern of sparse data.

One of the largest areas in which data tends toward sparseness is the EdX Clickstream dataset. We find a number of students rarely engaging whatsoever, and some students that engage in certain weeks but not in others. At least, this is what we have concluded from the fact that the data is entirely empty for many students in certain weeks. It could be, of course, that we have malformed data and are missing some events, but we are instead operating under the assumption that a lack of events indicates that no events were registered. This would then mean, of course, that we should just fill in these values with 0s - which is what we have decided to do. This is contrary to the typical strategy for filling in null values for machine learning -- which is filling in with the mean or median.

We are also facing a challenge with the forum data. Usage patterns in this class indicate that very few students engage with the forum whatsoever. Input from course designers indicates that these students often use personal Slack channels to collaborate. We, of course, couldn't access or use this data, as it is personal. For this reason, we don't have a great estimate of students' online interactions.
