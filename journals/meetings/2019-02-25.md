## 02/25/2019 - General Meeting

Meeting tasks:
1. Discussing status of data - in terms of new data sources to make sense of EdX SQL Data. We have also planned a separate "crash course" in MongoDB for the MongoDB team.
2. Team reallocation - Manley shifted to MongoDB team.
3. Discussion of forum data. We decided that we needed to make the Piazza data a priority for use, as EdX forums seem relatively unused. Additional question: Gardner & Brooks claim that forum data was relatively useless by itself, while Crossley claims that forum data is very useful. We will do our best to include this data source and explore its usefulness.
4. Shawn presented core concepts of Gardner & Brooks paper and machine learning as a whole.
