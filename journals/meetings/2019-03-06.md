## 03/06/2019 - General Meeting

During this meeting, we continued to work on the MongoDB interface scripting.

Big challenges right now include:

1. General unfamiliarity with the specific interface
2. Confusion between the "name" and "event_type" fields which are present in events. They seem to be somewhat interchangeable in many events, although it is clear that many don't have one or the other. There is some speculation that perhaps one of them might be older, and less used in recent courses.
