Shawn joined us for the meeting.

1. Checked in on everyone's progress in completing IRB certification for handling of sensitive FERPA-protected data, a prerequisite needed for data access. A few team members now have access to the first data source: Assignment data from EdX, from the C21U PostgreSQL relational database.
2. Found out timeline for other data sources. Canvas data is also hosted on a PostgreSQL database, but this one is controlled by a different department than C21U. This means we may have a slight delay on this data, but it might be relatively easy to manipulate once we do get access.
3. Found out that the clickstream data is hosted on a separate, expensive-to-operate server. For this reason, we will be limiting access to this data to only a few people: Maxwell and Arjun.
