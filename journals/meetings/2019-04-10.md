## 04/10/2019 - General Meeting

Individuals continued their work toward their individual goals during this meeting. Here I will record a few discussions we had about the possible future of the project.

One decision we made this semester was to separate X-data into individual weeks. This reduces the problem to predicting final success, given a 1-week snapshot of a student's performance. However, if  a student has reached a certain point in a course, we could theoretically access their entire history in the course, to that point. A proposal made: in the future, alter the structure of the input data to use all of the available data, up to a checkpoint. Perhaps the first month could be one checkpoind, then the second month, etc. Ideally, the model's accuracy increases over the months, until reaching a theoretical 100% accuracy at the end of the course as all information is available. This could be used to keep a rolling predicted grade for a student.
