## 03/13/2019 - General Meeting

This meeting was a work session. During this time slot, we worked to apply the discussion of the dataframe format from the previous subteam work session. This means refining previous aggregations in order to count events for a specific week, and a specific user. Ideally, this kind of aggregate could form a large portion of the X-data for any distinct tuple.

MongoDB's distinct accumulator syntax is challenging to deal with, and that is the biggest blocker at this time. It's a bit of trial-and-error process, and capturing the data we need will take some time. Elegance may also come later.
