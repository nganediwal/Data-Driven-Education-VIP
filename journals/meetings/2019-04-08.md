## 04/08/2019 - Subteam Meeting

Shawn constructed the student_event_counts table, which was created using student_event_counts.py by aggregating across course_id, user_id, week, event_type. This is a table in the PSQL database, and is ready to be joined with other tables for use in models!

We are gearing toward the end of the semester. Current goals are to have someone begin to work on models while everyone else is aggregating more data, so that we could theoretically plug-and-play more data as it "arrives." We believe that it would definitely be possible to present the outcomes of running models on this data by the final presentation, given that we work diligently over the coming week and a half.

We do not believe that the forum data will be ready/useful this semester. Discussions for the future include using a GT course like CS1301x so that the forum (Piazza) would be relatively populated. This kind of data, of course, offers uncertain benefit. Some in this field indicate that they primarily find the forum data to be worthless, while others indicate it to be quite useful. It depends dramatically on adoption, as well as the culture of a specific course's forum (things which might make forum-based models challenging to generalize). Nevertheless, we plan to add this next semester.
