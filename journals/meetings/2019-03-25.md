## 03/25/2019 - Subteam Meeting

This week, we continued individual work on the specific portions of the dataframe that we had addressed before the break. Selecting the attributes by week, by person, and by course is still the objective here. 

Mongo team continued trying to construct specific aggregates which target only a single tuple's data. SQL team is refining SQL queries which will obtain the grades of all verified students.

The ultimate goal is to have reproducibility on the scripts which obtain data, such that any student with access, in any semester, can easily, perhaps even in one step, obtain the data they need. With that in mind, work is being done on all fronts at once (forum, clickstream, assignment), with the hope that all of this data can be obtained together and merged into the final dataframe.
