## 02/20/2019 - General Meeting

Today, we spent the general meeting conducting a general work session.

The main focus of today's session was making sense of the SQL EdX data. We discussed that the assignments and submissions we have located clearly use the Open Response Assessment framework, but that elements typically present in the ORA framework are not present--and that we have no clue what assignment descriptions these submissions correspond to.

What we discovered: that there exists additional data which might prove useful. JSON-type data contains the definition of the assignments and quizzes in the course (as well as the content of each, the submission deadlines, and beyond), and would be useful for discovering a student's overall performance report. We have requested this data (and it should be with us soon).

Shawn provided a bit of insight into this data: that it will be added to the C21U server and stores, for each assignment, a key-metadata-children structure (what does this mean? we will see).
