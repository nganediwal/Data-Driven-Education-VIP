## 02/11/2019 - General Meeting

Today, we received a presentation from Emily, covering the basics of the LTI framework, the kind of authentication used for such a framework (featuring key/secret authentication), the development process of an LTI integration for use in an LMS like Canvas, and a couple of tools used to mock up an LMS for use with testing an LTI application.
