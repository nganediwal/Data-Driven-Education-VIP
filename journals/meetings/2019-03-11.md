## 03/11/2019 - Subteam Meeting

We continued our efforts with scripting in MongoDB in order to extract useful events and count them over certain common qualities (user, week, course). 

However, the primary discussion of this week was the dataframe. What it would look like, what it would primarily be composed of (in terms of the attribute), and also what the output value would be. It is becoming clear now that we aren't going to be able to put every week's information into a single tuple. This would result in at least 16 * n attributes, where n is the number of event types we are looking for. A problem with that many possible inputs is prone to long calculation times, overfitting, and poor generalization. For this reason, we are going to itemize inputs in by week. We've tossed around two possible ways of handling this: distinct models for each week, or a model which takes the week number as an X attribute.
