## 03/04/2019 - Subteam Meeting

During this meeting, the team primarily applied techniques presented in the previous meeting training. We worked on constructing aggregate statements and navigating the ISYE6501 database in order to zero in on useful data.

Among the challenges here is that each event contains a lot of data which is largely not useful. In fact, the only really useful information that we have identified so far in a given event are user_id, course_id, date, and event type. Specifically, we are thinking of purely counting the number of events that satisfy a particular combination of these attributes.

We hope to get this subset of data up and running soon, in order to be able to combine it with our existing forays into SQL/assignment data in order to obtain more useful information about student success.
