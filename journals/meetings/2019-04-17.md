## 04/17/2019 - General Meeting.

We presented our final presentation. It is available in the journals/presentations directory. We explained our process of obtaining data, some qualities of that data, correlations between certain fields, our process of deciding what input values to use and what output value to predict, and the performance of certain models on this data.

During the presentation, we selected an example model (a given tree, selected from a random forest) and walked through a demo of how this model is constructed and how it works in action--and also, what it means for the problem. For instance, this model had "play_video <= 0.5" as its root node. This indicates that this is the most important attribute, as determined by the criterion of "attribute which most reduces information" or "attribute which tells us the most about a given sample's probability of belonging to each of the two binary classes." This makes sense, as a student's participation in the course is heavily linked to their video plays, and a non-participating student is likely to do poorly in the class.

We presented our goals for the future: to implement Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling, to expand the data sources, to expand the classes studied, to work on selecting and comparing subsets of the data sources, and to possibly use different time frames in order to see what other similar problems we can tackle!
