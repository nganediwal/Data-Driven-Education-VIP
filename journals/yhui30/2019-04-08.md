Shawn created a table for clickstream data 

select * from edx.student_event_counts

## TODO:
1. Join grades_persistentsubsectiongrade with verified students

So first step is to figure out what are the fields inside table grades_persistentsubsectiongrade

course_id, user_id, usage_key, earned_all, possible_all, earned_graded, possible_graded, first_attempted, created, modified

Then let's try to join it with student_type

## Some notes:
<b>select e.course_id, e.user_id, e.mode, c.earned_all, c.possible_all, c.earned_graded, c.possible_graded from edx.student_type e inner join  edx.grades_persistentsubsectiongrade c on e.user_id = c.user_id and e.course_id = c.course_id and e.course_id = 'course-v1:GTx+ISYE6501x+3T2018' and e.learner_type = 'Verified' </b>
Need to double check as it has 10000+ rows

Shawn shows how powerful Tableu could be during the presentaiton for this week.
