# 3/11/2019

##TODO:
1. Set the goals for this week and spring break

##Some Notes:

This sql command is used to find the usage_key (block-v1:GT....) in order to do an inner join

select * from edx.grades_persistentsubsectiongrade where course_id='course-v1:GTx+ISYE6501x+3T2018'

It has following fields:
user_id, usage_key, earned_all, possible_all, earned_graded, possible_graded, first_attempted, created, modified 

Next step, join it with courseware_studentmodule 

select e.mode, c.name cohort, count(*) 
from edx.grades_persistentsubsectiongrade e
join edx.courseware_studentmodule c
	on 
	 c.course_id = e.course_id
	and e.course_id = 'course-v1:GTx+ISYE6501x+3T2018'
	and c.module_id = e.usage_id
group by e.mode, c.name;
