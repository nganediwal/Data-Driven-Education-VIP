## TODO:
1. Present on Wednesday 
2. Revisit our research question

## More notes: 
It has been a little difficult in using the data to get meaningful results. One of the main reason is that the data is not complete in sql databases, aka courseware_studentmodule. Therefore, I need to revisit our research question and figure out some new way to do it. 

So first I need to get all verified students' grades and save it as .csv . 

verified_student_grades.csv data structure: 
user_id, mode, is_active, is_active, last_login, percent_grade

The only userful part of this table is user_id and percent_grade

Then I tried to pull out all their assessment grades

Query #2 
select * from edx.submissions_score s where course_id = 'course-v1:GTx+ISYE6501x+3T2018'

Get all submission scores from the databases
And I figure out submissions_score table does not match user_id on verified students. Dead end 

Then I need to try the subsetctiongrade
