## Team Meeting:

## Tasks To Complete:
  - [Design UI mock-ups JITI Web App](https://www.figma.com/file/1GJh6SezoXZeVeBxIoJozP/JITI-Web-App?node-id=0%3A1)
  
    Our web application design was lacking in consistency, standard design practices, alignments, and asthetics. We decided to     design a mock-up that will act as a foundation for the app-dev team not only for this semester but for semesters to come.     The mock-up addresses all design challenges that existed in the web app.
