## What we did
After meeting the members of the subteam, and talked about potential research questions and request data. Also, we read a paper outlining model evalutation by Gardner and Brooks. There are 4 different data sets which are forum, clickstream, assignment, and a combo of each. The algorithms used to model them are naive bayes, adaboost, and a few more.

## HW
I need to finish/find IRB training, request data, understand Gardner and Brooks. Try and understand the algorithms and look up the data definitions.
