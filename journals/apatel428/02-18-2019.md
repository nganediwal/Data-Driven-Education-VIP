## What we did
Because of office hours I was not able to attend the meeting for its entirety, but during the meeting, we looked at the current databases and tried to see how students responded to assignments. A lot of it looked like it involved SQL, and some queries like averages for students were made. Looking at the formatting of the data will prove useful to clean the data more efficiently.

## HW
I'm still struggling to connect to the databases when using Docker. Shawn mentioned I might have to go through AWS directly and gain access to it if the problem persists.
