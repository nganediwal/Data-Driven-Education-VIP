## What we did
Shawn sent me the credentials to connect to the canvas data and MongoDB, so I tried to connect to it, but it doesn't seem to work on windows. It's a bit difficult to move forward at this point. I have credentials for aws and access to github, so we'll see when I can start working with the data. I wasn't able to attend this week's presentation due to my time conflict.

## HW
I can continue to look at the Gardner Brooks paper and specifically the forum feature points to see what I should work towards when I gain access to the data. I should look further into MongoDB and complete some tutorials as well. I'll inquire as to how I can help without access.
