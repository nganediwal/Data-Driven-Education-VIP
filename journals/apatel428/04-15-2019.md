## What we did
I couldn't attend last weeks workshop for Tableau. This is the final presentation week, so the main topic of discussion involved logistics for the presentation. The models that we will use are adaboost, logistic regression, gradient boost, and random forests. There's 230 students. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the libraries that are used to run these models, so I will focus on some of the less technical parts of the presentation towards the beginning like an overall summary of our goals and approach thru the semester.
