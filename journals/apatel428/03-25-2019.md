## What we did
I wasn't able to attend this week due to an interview, but Manley created a pretty complex mongoDB query that I don't exactly understand yet. I need to practice it a bit more, and I'll ask Manley for some clarification regarding the query and it's function/purpose.

## HW
I'll try to make queries for some of the easier features in the forum category. Number of posts and replies seems like a good starting point. Working off of that should allow me to tackle more complex problems moving forward.

db.forum.aggregate([
    { 
        $project: {
            "course_id": 1,
            "author_id": 1,
            "post_length": {
                $strLenCP: "$body"
            } 
        }
    },
    { 
        $group: { 
            _id: {
                "author_id": "$author_id",
                "course_id": "$course_id"
            }, 
            total: { 
                $sum: "$post_length" 
            } 
        } 
    },
    { 
        $sort: {
            total: -1 
        } 
    }
])
