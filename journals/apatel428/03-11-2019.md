## What we did
For the first time, I actually have access to the data. I gained a little bit of clarity as to what my next steps should be. To be specific, I need to find some of the feature points identified in the Garnder Brooks paper regarding the forum data. For example, the sentiment of the language of the posts and data surrounding it. This should help feed data into the model.

## HW
Play around with mongoDB.
some useful functions are:

show collections : function which shows collections
show dbs : function which shows databases
use ISYE6501 : function which switches to ISYE6501 database
forum_data = db.ISYE6501.find() creates an array which you can search thru
isyeData[0] = 0th element of ISYE6501 array
db.ISYE6501.findOne() = one document/element in ISYE6501
