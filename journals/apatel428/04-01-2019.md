## What we did
We had a presentation this week where we went over our overall plan and approach to tackle the problems. Also we identified some problems we were having and the methods we were using to solve them. The other subteam group mentioned that it would be useful to meet with them, so we will probably do that next week.

## HW
Continue cleaning data and figuring out useful features. Manley appears to be testing out some of the models, so I should probably get a deeper understanding of the models. For reference they are:

SVM : supervised learning models which kind of works by finding parameters and seperating by classes/lines/hyperplanes

CART : need clarification

L2LR : need clarification

Naive Bayes : model which selects the best hypothesis (h) given data (d), based on bayes theorem -> P(h|d) = (P(d|h) * P(h)) / P(d)

Adaboost :  focuses on classification problems and aims to convert a set of weak classifiers into a strong one
