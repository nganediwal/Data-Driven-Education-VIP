## What we did
Shawn summarized and gave a run down on the core functions of MongoDB. He also set aside some time to help me set up docker on my machines, but he struggled as well. Apparently, by next week I'll be able to pull an image with having to set up all of the dependencies. The problem is a windows vs linux/mac sort of thing.

## HW
Shawn will be hosting a MongoDB workshop, so we will learn more about the syntax and useful functions there. He also mentioned he would help me connect to docker or he'll try and make a docker image that I can pull.
