## What we did
We set up and discussed docker and its uses. I'll be working with MongoDB and the Canvas data in the future. Moving forward, we'll attempt to clean the data, develop models, and then evaluate the models. We should have access to EdX now, but I need docker to work on my machine still

## HW
I need access to the Canvas data and MongoDB, so I'll familiarize myself with MongoDB. Look at the edx data structure.
