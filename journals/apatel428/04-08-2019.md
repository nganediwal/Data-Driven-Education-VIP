## What we did
For the forum data, there doesn't seem to be too much activity. EdX forums are pretty much dead because the students make their own groups via GroupMe or Slack or something  else. If Piazza was used, it could be a lot more useful. As a student, I can testify that Piazza is very active and useful for us, and personally, I use/visit it often. It's a bit too late for me to pivot to focus on sql, so I will continue with what I have now. Shawn mentioned that we would set up a workshop on Tableau so we can get some graphs for the final presentation. I have no prior experience with it, so I'll try and attend.

## HW
Find some more feature points and see what I can do with Tableau after the workshop.
