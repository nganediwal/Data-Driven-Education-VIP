Determined individuals in both SQL and mongoDB teams: 
- will be working on SQL team 
- could potentially cross-over into mongoDB team (switch off) in the future 
*disclaimer: if working on both teams must be responsible for both deadlines*

Potential Goals: 
- Two Fridays (week before 10/11) = within teams, must write queries to extract features 
*look at old queries for inspiration, explore data, use data documentation, look at papers*

- Three Fridays (10/25) = begin to engineer features that are based on the features obtained

- Hope to eventually run a python script inside a container
*be able to control and run queries
*be able to perform data/feature engineering
*be able to output pandas (spreadsheet format) data frame 

Began to look into old SQL code to examine old data within pgAdmin4 (beginning to find potential query features for data collection)
