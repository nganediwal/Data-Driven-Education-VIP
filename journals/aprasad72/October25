Sub-team Weekly Meeting: 

Objective: 
Establishing standards for postgresSQL team (utilizing PgAdmin database)

Established expectations for training model for all the data that is gathered and cleaned 

Tasks completed: 

- Examined and analyzed old data tables from previous SQL queries
- Continued reviewing Gardner and Brookes research paper to identify additional attributes that could potentially be incorporated into newly created queries 

Personal goal: 

- Begin writing new queries utilizing format and structure of previous queries 
- Look into joining and pivoting tables within PgAdmin using SQL 

Code snippet: 

--select*
--from
--(
--select user_id, course_id, sum(n_days_active) total_days_active --alias for sum (immediately after)
--from edx.student_active_days
--where n_days_active > 1
--group by user_id, course_id
--order by total_days_active desc
--limit 100
--) sum_table
--where total_days_active > 226 --do where on aggregation so must use alias

/* this a multi line comment
  just like in java */
select *
from edx.student_active_days st
join edx.student_courseaccessrole b
    on st.user_id = b.user_id
     and st.course_id = b.course_id
