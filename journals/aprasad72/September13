9/13/19 Meeting Notes: 

Discussed pgAdmin4 software
Downloaded and looked into pgAdmin4: 
- ran and tested a few SQL files from GT Git repository (potential files we will be using this semester) 
- looked into potential cases/variables that will be used this semester 
- examined problems within Garner research paper 

*learned about queries in pgAdmin4 with SQL code* 
*looked at features (i.e. user ID matches and other conditions)*

Wednesday's Presentation: 
- looked into phrasing research question 
- determined who would be responsible for each section 
- examined old presentations 
- potential research question: master plan = part 1 including data, part 2 including models, and evaluations 
- determine possible intervention methods (i.e. email, app, etc.) 

*hope to predict student droupout rates within the course, hopefully enable professor to intervene before failing the class or dropout from the class*
*look potentially into reasons for doing poorly*

*consider time intervals for data collection (i.e. lagged data ~ week 1 - week 4 and each individual week)*

*look at old data = driving data 
*look at new data = testing data 

Data arrangement: 
- current available data (i.e. old and new data creating a mixture of both)
- as stated above, looking into old data used for training and new data from current semesters for testing 

Goals: 
- having a table including both student and current week data 
- running python scripts inside a container to be able to control queries that are used 
- be able to complete data engineering with collected data 
- provide an output for Panda dataframe 

Presentation assignment: 
- looking into what data will be collected and from where
- from edX and Canvas (examining clickstream data from edX and assignment grades from Canvas)
