Over the course of the past week, the primary work I completed was related to our presentation on Wednesday, 02/06. I prepared slides on Tuesday night for the presentation, trying to package all of our goals and completed/upcoming tasks into a brief summary. It was somewhat clarifying: it helped me get a permanent, set-in-stone, framework for the 3 main phases of our project: Data, Models, and Evaluation.

After the presentation, we talked through some of our plans with other members of the VIP in order to refine some of our next steps. Specifically, we determined that we'd need to refine our research scope to a smaller set of students. Although we didn't get a chance to fully decide among the team what our goal was, I personally would like to refine the project to cover specifically and exclusively the verified and Micro-masters students who are not OMSA students.

This would reduce our need to use Canvas, which stores grades for OMSA students. This would, in my opinion, make our job a lot easier, by limiting our research scope to only EdX/Clickstream. In addition, not using audit students would mean that we would only be examining students who have some monetary incentive to complete/succeed in the course.

## TO-DO:

1. Continue cleaning EdX SQL server for data
2. Explore methods for using Docker Secrets to securely swap in individual data credentials into the Docker container.
