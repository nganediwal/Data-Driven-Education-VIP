This week, we delivered our third presentation. This was a bit of a challenging week for me, as between several projects I needed to complete for other courses and several exams I did not have time to create the slides as usual.

Our presentation specifically addressed the issues which have been slowly arising from the use of the clickstream data: the sparseness. There are many students who only register certain events (like play_video) in somewhere around half of the weeks we examined. This event is one of the most common, meaning that users are simply not engaging with the platform in a number of weeks. We don't know if this might mean that there exist some gaps in the data collection, or if this simply shows that the proportion of students who actively engage with the material is just quite low.

Another question raised this week was the validity of the forum data. We have learned that the EdX forum for this course is largely unused. Course designers indicate that most students tend to get support through user-run Slack channels, instead of official platforms. So this data might not be as useful, sadly.

## TODO:

1. Continue working on conversion of event list to output dataframe
2. Determine which attributes are in fact useful.
