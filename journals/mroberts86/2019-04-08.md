This week, I followed up on the Todos from two weeks prior.

First, I added the ability to specify the week number in the aggregate query, and construct a list of weeks to iterate across. Now, the list sums up the number of events by type, by user, by week.

I also added the beginning of functionality to sift through the JSON-style output of these queries and convert this into a dataframe by constructing a list of all users, building a nulled-out tuple for each user, and then filling in the values in these tuples while iterating across all of the type-user-week pairs.

Ideally, we will create a NumPy Array (which might be relatively sparse, depending on how often the typical student engages with all features of the platform), and then convert this NumPy Array to a csv -- or simply hold the data in RAM and run models on the NumPy array.

## TODO:

1. Complete functionality of conversion to csv output
2. Determine a policy for handling null values in array
