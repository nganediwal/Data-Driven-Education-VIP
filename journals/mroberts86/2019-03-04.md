This week, I attended a MongoDB usage session with Shawn and the MongoDB team.
I also prepared our second presentation slides, which are available under journals/presentations.

# MongoDB Notes:

show dbs
	subset collection is a smaller dataset to test queries on before exposing to entire database
	leave ec2 instance running after we are done, it will auto-shutdown

find()
	Small collections - can use find to obtain a javascript array (read to memory, lazily)
	Large collections - do not do this (will read 90GB array to memory)
	doing any operations on the db.collection.find() will convert to full array in memory (EdXCollection is 90 GB - be careful)

findOne()
	find a single element

find(n)
	find up to n elements

find({dictionary})
	similar to a SELECT ... WHERE in SQL
	powerful tools in Mongo API
		for example: $gt: my_date - makes it select dates greater than my_date

aggregate
	similarly powerful collection method
	author_id should match directly to user_id in SQL
	{ $match: } similar to WHERE
	{ $group: } groups 
	{ $sum: 1 } will count the number of a specific ID

## TO-DO:

1. Apply MongoDB techniques to get a sense of what the data looks like in the clickstream server.
