# 10/25/2019

- Tough week. Due to some family issues, absent for weekly meeting.
- As I understand, team underwent a SQL crash course on Friday lead by Shawn.
  - As entire team is now responsible for writing SQL queries, this should help everyone contribute successfully in upcoming weeks while continuing to collect and aggregate data.
  - I need to make sure to brush up on my own SQL to ensure that I can help answer any questions folks might have.
  
## To-Do:

- Investigate old queries in SQL to ensure that they still function
- Investigate SQL pivots (will be needed for the aggregation we aim to do, and weren't quite covered in SQL crash course).
