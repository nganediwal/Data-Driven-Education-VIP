Running complex queries in mongo shell lends itself to a lot of copy-and-pasting of long aggregate statements. For this reason, I decided this week that I wanted to construct a system to easily run mongo scripts from file and then dump into output files.

I created a script called

```
mongo.sh
```

which takes in a .js file and an output file and runs the script before dumping into the output. Of course, we do have to be careful with this kind of thing, as creating output files with personally identifiable information and then uploading these files into cloud platforms like GitHub, Dockerhub, or even Slack is against FERPA policy.

For this reason, the shell script is designed for any user to be able to connect to MongoDB on their own, from inside the Docker container, and then collect data from a particular .js.

On a separate note, I created the forum_views.js script, which can be run with 

```
mongo.sh <.js script> <output_file.txt>
```

It's a simple script which just counts all of the events of each type in the ISYE6501 ClickStream Data. This helps us determine what events are actually useful to us (because extremely rare events typically can't predict success as well as more common events).

## TODO:

1. Construct a script which is able to isolate events of a given type and within a given time frame, and return them.
2. Identify the best attribute in events to determine the event type: "event_type" or "name"
