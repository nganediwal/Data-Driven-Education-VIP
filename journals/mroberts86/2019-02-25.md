The bulk of my work this week has been involved in trying to decipher the problem described in last week's journal (and recent meeting logs). This problem is the relative difficulty of making any real sense of the assignment data, especially considering that the ORA (Open Response Assessment) infrastructure isn't really present.

After we discovered collectively that we required additional data in order to make any real sense of the assignments currently on the EdX server, we decided that there wasn't any particularly useful work to do in that direction for the time being. 

I may be shifting to MongoDB team soon, in order to provide additional support with the data processing from that source.

## TO-DO:

1. Obtain additional data for EdX assignment descriptions, figure out how to connect with submissions tuples
2. Attend MongoDB training session 
3. Prepare presentation for second subteam presentations
