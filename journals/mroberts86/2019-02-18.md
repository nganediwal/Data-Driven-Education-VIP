So far this week, I've assembled a quick Trello board, according to the preferences of other team members, who decided to use Trello over Github Projects.

## TO-DO:

1. Search for quiz/homework submission data in ISyE 6501 portion of EdX data - by student, looking for features such as number of quiz/homework submissions, and date of submissions vs actual due dates.
2. Explore methods for using Docker Secrets to securely swap in individual data credentials into the Docker container.
