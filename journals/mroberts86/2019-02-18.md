I've assembled a quick Trello board, according to the preferences of other team members, who decided to use Trello over Github Projects.

I also have spent time examining the SQL database in order to determine how to find (specifically) the time and date of assignment/quiz submissions. The challenge here is that I'm able to find the time and date of submissions, but I am unsure how these submissions match up to the assignments themselves (and actually, I am totally unable to find the assignments themselves).

Part of the challenge is that the EdX data reference documentation refers to a "Rubric" table, which is the top-level parent table for a large inter-connected tree of assessment-related data. This table does not contain any entries for the course in question - Fall 2018 ISyE 6501.

I plan on discussing this further with the team in this week

## TO-DO:

1. Search for quiz/homework submission data in ISyE 6501 portion of EdX data - by student, looking for features such as number of quiz/homework submissions, and date of submissions vs actual due dates.
2. Explore methods for using Docker Secrets to securely swap in individual data credentials into the Docker container.
