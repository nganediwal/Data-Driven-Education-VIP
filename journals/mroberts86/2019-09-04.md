## Notes on Project Management
* Waterfall
  - sequential stages, no going back to a previous stage
  - Requirements --> Design --> Development --> Testing --> Deployment
  - Example: Macintosh Computer, built all the way from an idea to specification
* Agile
  - Fail Fast
  - Cycle of building, testing, feedback, re-evaluation, and so on
  - Example: Prototype iPhones which led to realizing that a clickwheel-style touch interface was not so good, and improving the interface.
  - Adaptable, multi-disciplinary teams, Standard Practice, Hyped up
  - Slow, can be disappointing or have red tape, interoperability can be an issue, can be too hyped up
* Data Science
  - Problem Solving with Data
  - Prediction
  - New Measurements
* MS Team Data Science Process
  - Business Understanding is alwasy first. It branches out to Modeling and Data Acquisition & Understanding
  - Data Acquisition & Understanding
    * Data Source
    * Pipeline
    * Environment
    * Wrangling, Exploration, Cleaning
  - Modeling
    * Feature Engineering
    * Model Training
    * Model Evaluation
  - These two branches then move into Deployment
    * Web deployment
    * Scoring
    * Performance
  - After deployment, we move to Customer Acceptance
* Role Mappings
  - Project Manager - Business Understanding
  - Data Scientist - Modeling
  - Data Engineer - Data Acquisition & Understanding
  - Web Developer - Deployment
* Guidelines
  - Define problem in as much detail as possible at the outset
  - Talk to stakeholders before writing any code if possible
  - Divide project into manageable portions and assign team members on a project management board like Trello
  - Build simple product first, then make better one
  - Keep GitHub organized, cross-reference with Trello
  - Be flexible, open to iteration on key areas
