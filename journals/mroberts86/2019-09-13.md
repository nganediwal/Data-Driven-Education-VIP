# Brainstorm for presentation 1
- High-level discussion and motivation
  - Students getting individual, tailored attention from professor based on predicted success
  - Thinking about patterns of accessing/reaching students depending on predictions
    - Is student in charge of prediction or professor
  - Use feature importance to determine why a student may or may not be likely to succeed
- Low-level
  - Two arrangements of data
    - One is all data mixed together, from which train/test data selected
    - Other is using all past data to train, most recent semester as test
  - Data sources
    - Clickstream
    - Assignment
  - Modeling
    - Prediction of drop-out week (or no drop-out) - several possibilities.
      - Survival analysis
      - Will the student drop out next week?
      - Probability of drop out in next week.
    - Prediction of final success/grade if student does not drop out.
  - Problem Granularity
    - Weekly analysis is the "unit of time"
    - Use past data up through this week
      - Lag: might interfere with the ability to get a prediction early in the class.
