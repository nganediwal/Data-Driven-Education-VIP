                <p>
                    I am a junior at Georgia Tech studying computer science with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction and Intelligence. I expect to graduate by December 2021. I work at the GT School of Industrial & Systems Engineering as an IT Assistant
                    and Web Developer. <br /><br /> I spend most of my spare time building software and learning about deep learning. You can view my projects under my
                    <a href="https://github.com/atush-dhakal" target="blank">GitHub profile.</a
            >
            <br />
            <br />I am most comfortable with Java and have limited experience
            with Python, Javascript, and Node.js. I have used Bootstrap, Django,
            Flask, JavaFx, Tensorflow, and PyTorch framework for my projects.
            <br />
            <br />I am always open to challenging opportunities that test my
            limitations and enables me to do impactful work. I am especially
            interested in education technology. <br /><br />
            I have learned to test assumptions and question every design choice
            using First Principles Approach before undertaking any project.

          <h2>Past<br /><br /></h2>
          <p>
            I interned as Product Development Associate at FocalPointK12, a
            growth-stage startup based in Norcross, Georgia. During my year-long
            internship, I started as a Web Developer and later performed a
            variety of tasks as I worked closely with the CEO. Some of those
            tasks include market research, formulating go-to-market strategies
            for India, China, and co-led marketing campaigns in America and
            Asia. <br /><br />
            I also served as Executive Vice President (EVP) of the Student Body
            at Georgia State University Dunwoody campus before transferring to
            Georgia Tech. As EVP, I successfully led campaigns to

              target="blank"
              >extend library hours</a
            >, create the first rideshare zone in GSU, create partnerships with
            the political science department, local and state leaders, and
            install more than ten signage on campus. This opportunity to serve
            more than fifty thousand students was one of the most enriching
            experiences I have ever had.
            <br />
            <br />Before serving as the EVP of GSU, I served as Senator of
            Governmental Affairs of GSU Dunwoody Senate.

            <br /><br />I was also one of the two Senior Supplemental
            Instruction leaders for Calculus at GSU Perimeter College.
